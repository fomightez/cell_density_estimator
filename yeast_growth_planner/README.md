Yeast Growth Planner - A tool that performs calculations that aid in growing yeast suitable for use in experiments or for calculating doubling time.
===========================================================
 
For those not interested in the code behind this but just want to quickly get a value, I'd suggest the web version of this tool [COMING SOON here, POSSIBLY??](UPDATE WHEN DONE).

In order to run a fully functional interactive version in your browser, [click here](http://mybinder.org/repo/fomightez/methods_in_yeast_genetics/notebooks/yeast_growth_planner/yeast%20growth%20planner.ipynb). Alternatively, you'll need to download the notebook and run it somewhere you have set to work with IPython or Jupyter Notebooks. (If you don't have your own computer set up for that, I'd suggest using [Domino Data Lab](http://www.dominodatalab.com/), [Wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/), or [SageMath Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com) and working in the cloud.) The Jupyter notebook (formlery IPython notebook) for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/yeast_growth_planner/blob/master/yeast%20growth%20planner.ipynb) in this repo, and the static form is best viewed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fomightez/methods_in_yeast_genetics/blob/master/yeast_growth_planner/yeast%20growth%20planner.ipynb). 

This tool should help you prepare your yeast cells for various experiments. You just need to edit the values to match your situation and run the calculations.
