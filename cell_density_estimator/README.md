# cell_density_estimator - A  tool facilitating determining yeast cell density using absorbance readings.
 
For those not interested in the code behind this but just want to use the estimator, I'd suggest the web version of this tool [here](UPDATE WHEN DOWN).

The IPython notebook for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/cell_density_estimator/blob/master/cell_density_estimator_for_multiple_samples.ipynb) in this repo. In order to have the fully functional interactive version, you'll need to download it and run it somewhere you have set to work with IPython or Jupyter Notebooks. (If you don't have your own computer set up for that, I'd suggest using [Domino Data Lab](http://www.dominodatalab.com/), [Wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/), or [SageMath Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com) and working in the cloud.)

This tool should help you count your cells in culture or roughly determine cell concentration using only OD660 readings from a spectrophotometer.

If you trying to understand the underlying code for the calculations here, it may be easier to follow along on a notebook where a single sample is evaluated [here](https://github.com/fomightez/cell_density_estimator/blob/master/cell_density_estimator_for_single_sample.ipynb).
